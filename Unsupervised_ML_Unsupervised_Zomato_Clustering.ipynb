        "The rapid growth of online food discovery and delivery platforms has transformed how customers choose restaurants and how businesses compete for visibility. Platforms like Zomato rely heavily on ratings and reviews to influence consumer decisions; however, these signals are often subjective, inconsistent, and emotionally driven. This project aims to analyze the Zomato restaurant ecosystem using data analytics and exploratory techniques to uncover meaningful patterns behind customer behavior, restaurant performance, and perception.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project utilizes two primary datasets: restaurant metadata and customer reviews. The restaurant dataset includes attributes such as location, cuisine type, average cost for two, rating, and delivery availability, while the reviews dataset captures customer opinions expressed through text and associated ratings. Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of both quantitative metrics and qualitative sentiment within the food service industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial phase of the project focused on data preprocessing and cleaning. Real-world datasets often contain missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicate records, and noisy textual content. These issues were systematically addressed by handling null values, standardizing rating scales, normalizing cost variables, and cleaning review text through stopword removal, punctuation filtering, and case normalization. This preprocessing ensured that subsequent analysis was accurate, reliable, and interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends and relationships between key variables. Several important insights emerged during this phase. One notable observation was that higher pricing does not necessarily correlate with higher customer ratings. Many mid-range restaurants received ratings comparable to or better than premium establishments, indicating that perceived value plays a crucial role in customer satisfaction. Additionally, restaurants offering online delivery showed higher engagement and review frequency, highlighting the growing importance of convenience in customer decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cuisine-based analysis revealed strong regional preferences, with certain cuisines consistently performing better in specific locations. This suggests that cultural familiarity and local demand significantly influence restaurant success. City-level comparisons further showed that customer expectations vary by region, affecting how strictly ratings are assigned. These findings emphasize that ratings should be interpreted within contextual boundaries rather than as universal benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "To gain deeper insight beyond numerical ratings, review text was analyzed using basic sentiment analysis techniques. This allowed the classification of reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Interestingly, a mismatch was observed in several cases where high ratings were accompanied by negative sentiment in text, often due to isolated complaints about service delays or pricing. This highlights a key limitation of relying solely on numerical ratings and demonstrates the importance of textual analysis for understanding true customer sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the primary focus of the project was exploratory analysis, the dataset structure also allows for future extensions into machine learning applications such as rating prediction, sentiment classification, and restaurant success modeling. However, the project intentionally prioritizes interpretability and business relevance over complex modeling, ensuring that insights remain actionable for stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to real-world consumer platforms to extract meaningful insights from both structured and unstructured data. By questioning surface-level metrics and analyzing underlying patterns, the project provides a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior and restaurant performance. The findings are valuable for customers seeking better decision-making tools, restaurant owners aiming to improve service quality, and platforms like Zomato looking to enhance recommendation systems and user trust."

        "**Online food platforms such as Zomato rely primarily on user ratings and reviews to influence customer decisions and restaurant visibility. However, numerical ratings are often subjective and may not accurately reflect true customer satisfaction. Written reviews contain valuable qualitative insights, but they are unstructured and difficult to analyze at scale. This creates a gap between customer sentiment and the ratings presented on the platform. As a result, customers may make unreliable choices, and restaurants may receive unclear feedback on performance. There is a need for a data-driven approach that combines restaurant metadata with review analysis to uncover meaningful patterns. This project addresses the challenge by applying exploratory data analysis and sentiment-based insights to better understand customer behavior and restaurant performance.**"

Categorical variables were examined for unique values to support proper encoding decisions. Initial exploratory analysis revealed a one-to-many relationship between restaurants and reviews. It was observed that some variables contained high variability, indicating the presence of outliers. The dataset also showed that customer reviews provide richer insights than ratings alone.
